Slideshow (carousel) of pictures for web

If you need to add more pictures to the slideshow, you only need 
to modify the html version; the script of javascript will do the rest.

Nonetheless, the code is heavily commented in case you want to change
any of the controls, such as the speed, the pausing time, the number of .

The one and only thing you may need to extra worry about, is the 
route of the pictures 

I know that it is good practice to separate css, html, and javascript
in different files but I am posting it this way to increase readability.

This version is using entirely javascript. I will later post a cleaner 
version using php using the MVC model.
